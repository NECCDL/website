Teams are responsible for restoring their systems to operational status on their own, but sometimes this is not possible.
The Black Team offers a point-based reduction to fix a system or provide assistance.
The goal behind this change is to balance between encouraging teams to seek help when genuinely needed and fostering independent problem-solving.

### Pricing Breakdown

Each team is given a budget of 1000 points that they can spend on assistance from the Black Team.
Spent points will count against system scoring.

| Type                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Cost |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Server Redeployments                  | Cleanly redeploy the server to a pre-competition state.                                                                                                                                                             | 30   |
| Instance Connectivity Troubleshooting | Removing firewall rules that block instance connectivity, etc. If the Black Team cannot connect themselves, a server redeployment will likely be required instead.                                                  | 30   |
| Account Logout                        | Password reset for any user (Blue, Black, Employee). If the Black Team cannot connect themselves, a server redeployment will be required instead.                                                                   | 10   |
| System Reboot                         | Reboot of the system from the control plane. Excessive use will result in a 10-point fee per occurrence.                                                                                                            | 0\*  |
| Competent Questions                   | Thoughtful questions that include information on what your team has already tried, including results if applicable.<br>Abuse of this offering or questions that lack any prior effort will result in a 5-point fee. | 0\*  |
| Competition Setup Questions           | This includes questions related to initial environment VPN setup, access to initial credentials, questions designated to Black, White or Red Teams, and the like.                                                   | 0    |

Each assistance request that has a point cost will be multiplied by the corresponding number in the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) (excluding 0).
For example, the first request will cost x1, the second x1, the third x2, and so on, following the sequence of Fibonacci numbers.
