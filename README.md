# NECCDL Website

## Development

You may need to remove the `public` directory if there are weird artifacts from previous builds after major changes.

```bash
npm run start
```

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up

# Exposed on http://localhost:8080
```

Search seems a little bugged, removes the port.

## Publishing

```bash
rm -r public

npm run build
npx -y pagefind --site public
```
